## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

#### Test Controls

- Start a test by clicking the start button or by clicking the passage and typing
- Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for passages of varying complexity
- Switch between "Timed (60s)" mode and "Passage" mode (timer counts up, no limit)
- Restart at any time to get a new random passage from the selected difficulty

#### Typing Experience

- See real-time WPM, accuracy, and time stats while typing
- See visual feedback showing correct characters (green), errors (red/underlined), and cursor position
- Correct mistakes with backspace (original errors still count against accuracy)

#### Results & Progress

- View results showing WPM, accuracy, and characters (correct/incorrect) after completing a test
- See a "Baseline Established!" message on their first test, setting their personal best
- See a "High Score Smashed!" celebration with confetti when beating their personal best
- Have their personal best persist across sessions via localStorage

#### UI & Responsiveness

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements

### Additional (optional) challenges

1.  Add multiple test durations (15s, 30s, 60s, 120s)
2.  Add different text categories to type, such as famous quotes, song lyrics, or code snippets
3.  Track WPM and accuracy over time using local storage
4.  Add a keyboard heatmap showing errors and keypress frequency
5.  Create shareable result cards for social media

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("🎉");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
